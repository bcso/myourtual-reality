We also knew about the Myo by thalmic labs, so we decided to use this and create an app where the user could interact with the AR environment by switching back and forth the AR object with the myo through gestures. Additionally the user can increase and decrease the size of the object in a similar manner, while rotating and pitching/yawing the object on 3 degrees of freedom.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n- Vuforia SDK for android\r\n- Myo SDK for android\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIn 2014, Li Xuanji (@zodiac) and Brian So (@bcso) created this using Qualcomm's Vuforia virtual reality API and Thalmic Labs Myo API.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
