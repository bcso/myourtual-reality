Qualcomm - Best Use of Vuforia @ Boilermake 2014

http://challengepost.com/software/myourtual-reality

We were inspired by the AR platform called Vuforia which could let users do many things with thier mobile device and 3d object projections on to surfaces. We also knew about the Myo by thalmic labs, so we decided to use this and create an app where the user could interact with the AR environment by switching back and forth the AR object with the myo through gestures. Additionally the user can increase and decrease the size of the object in a similar manner, while rotating and pitching/yawing the object on 3 degrees of freedom.

## Requirements

- Vuforia SDK for android
- Myo SDK for android
